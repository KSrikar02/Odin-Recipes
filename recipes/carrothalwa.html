    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kilogram Carrots grated with thick grater, 10-12 medium carrots</li>
        <li>1 litre Whole Milk</li>
        <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon Cardamom powder (Elaichi)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon Ghee divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Sliced Pistachios or mixed nuts or raisins, to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Process</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash, peel and grate carrots using the thick side of a hand grater or food processor.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of ghee to a pan on medium heat. Add the chopped pistachios (and other nuts) and roast until they become lightly golden in color. If adding raisins, add them now. Roast for 15 seconds more, take out and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the grated carrots to a large pan and turn heat to medium-high. Saute the carrots for 5 minutes so that some of the moisture is removed.</li>
        <li>Now add the milk to the same pan and let the milk (with the carrots) come to a boil. Then lower the heat to medium flame, and let the it cook. You want to cook the carrots until all the liquid is evaporated. Stir frequently as you dont want the halwa to scorch the bottom of the pan. This will take about 35-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now add the sugar to the halwa. The sugar will release water and make the halwa a little liquidy. Cook until the halwa becomes dry again.</li>
        <li>Now add the cardamom powder, and remaining ghee and mix will the carrot halwa. Roast for a minute for the ghee to blend into the halwa.</li>
        <li>Garnish with the roasted nuts. Serve warm as is or topped with vanilla ice-cream! </li>
    </ol>
